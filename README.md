# Price prediction for AirBnB properties in Paris


## Project Overview

This project explores the development of a pricing recommendation tool for Airbnb hosts in Paris, leveraging both traditional linear regression and 
spatial regression techniques. The goal is to assess how geographical factors—such as proximity to amenities, tourist attractions, 
and neighborhood characteristics—affect Airbnb property prices, and to evaluate whether incorporating spatial features improves predictive accuracy.

The study is based on a dataset of ~84,000 Airbnb listings from InsideAirbnb.
